# ZNukem's Duke's Mighty Launcher
It is a game launcher for Duke Nukem Forever (2011), designed to make it easy for users and myself to run.

## Features
- A button to launch the game once a selection is made.
- Run maps, either user or custom maps, from the single-player mode via a dropdown menu.
- Directly select Difficulty from the dropdown menu.
- Run custom mods from a JSON configuration with an example for DML.
- Buttons to launch the map editor.

## What's Next
The next steps include:
- Refining the program.
- Server INI Switcher for easier user access, allowing users to switch from normal to deprecated server protocols.
- Exploring multiplayer options, potentially adding dedicated server options and a browsing feature.
- Incorporating DukeNukemCentral.com, opening it in a web browser for users to access content.
- And more features to be added to come.
